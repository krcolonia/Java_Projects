[ COLLEGE ] Java Projects

This repository serves as a backup for all of my Java projects created during my time in University as a student in BSIT.
Some of these projects are done solo, some of then are done with a couple of groupmates/friends of mine.

Beware, as some of my older projects and codes are very trash and that some of these might not even be applicable in
programs for real-life use and situations.
